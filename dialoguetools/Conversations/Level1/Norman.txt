		You don't know about the Umbrella Man? What are they teaching you at this sheep-shit school?
		Blake
		Construction management.
		Norman
		Well, sit down and listen the fuck up. You know who assassinated John F. Kennedy, right?
		Blake
		John Wilkes Oswald, or something.
		Norman
		That's what they want you to think.
		Norman
		Watch the footage more closely, and look at the guy standing right next to Kennedy's car.
		Blake
		The Umbrella Man?
		Norman
		You're damn right, the Umbrella Man!
		Norman
		It's a beautiful day in Houston, Texas. Not a cloud in the sky.
		Norman
		No reason anyone should be carrying an umbrella.
		Norman
		But then you see the Umbrella Man, holding an open umbrella.
		Norman
		And right when the motorcade passes, you know what happens?
		Blake
		It starts raining?
		Norman
		Kennedy is shot, you shit-for-brains.
		Norman
		Anyway, scientists looked into it, and an umbrella would be the perfect place to hide a poisonous dart.
		Norman
		Was the Umbrella Man at the wrong place at the wrong time?
		Norman
		Or did he shoot a poisonous dart at the president and then open his umbrella as a signal to the gunmen?
		Blake
		It sounds like he was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
		Norman
		Fucking construction management majors. That's what they want you to think.
		Norman
		You want to know something real juicy about this Umbrella Man?
		Blake
		Not really.
		Norman
		That hairy-nippled motherfucker killed my father.
		Blake
		Your dad was John F. Kennedy?
		Norman
		No, you cum dumpster.
		Norman
		My father was Norman Wilbur Hermanson II, and he was the greatest man I ever knew.
		Norman
		That is, until the Umbrella Man broke into our house and bludgeoned him to death with his umbrella.
		Norman
		The doctors said it was a heart attack.
		Norman
		But I know it was the Umbrella Man.
		Blake
		And if I give you my spare change, what exactly are you going to do?
		Norman
		I will buy my own umbrella, find the Umbrella Man, engage him in an umbrella duel, and avenge my father's death!
		Norman
