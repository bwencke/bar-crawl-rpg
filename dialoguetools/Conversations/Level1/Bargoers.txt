	Washing Machine
	STATEMENTS
		O'Brien
		A washing machine! A rarity back in the home country.
		O'Flanagan
		As lads, O'Brien and I would wash our clothes in Ireland's burbling streams.
		O'Brien
		And ourselves. Oh, how the streams burbled!
		O'Flanagan
		Now, without Irish springs, we make do with Irish Spring! Ha ha!

		O'Flanagan
		Sorry lad, but we're just poor Irishmen.
		O'Brien
		Not a penny to our names.
		O'Flanagan
		I once had six pence. Those were cheery days.
		O'Brien
		Cheery days, long faded into memory. Halcyon days!
		O'Flanagan
		My 16 brothers took my six pence. To the pub!
		O'Brien
		They wanted Guinness. I'd betray my brothers for a Guinness.
		Blake
		How did you guys pay for those beers?
		O'Brien
		Traveler's cheques!
		O'Flanagan
		Traveler's cheques are the Irishman's lifeblood!
		O'Brien
		His bread! His potatoes! His warm goat's milk in a gilded pan!
		Blake
		Are you really poor, then, if you have traveler's checks?
		O'Flanagan
		Every Irishman is poor, in his heart and in his soul.
		O'Brien
		Poverty is our national identity.
		Blake
		Is it because leprechauns stole all your gold?
		O'Flanagan
		No leprechaun has stolen gold of mine. Because I never had any!
		O'Brien
		Oh, those pesky leprechauns, and their tricks!
