		Not particularly. But I love to gamble!

		Who did you put your money on for the big race?
		Gambler
		I haven't decided yet. Tell you what -- if you can guess the winner for me, I'll buy you a drink.
		Blake
		And what if I'm wrong?
		Gambler
		Hmm. Then I get the washing machine.
		Blake
		OK, I'll ask around for some opinions and get back to you.

		I don't gamble that much -- maybe a few times per day.
		Blake
		How much money have you won?
		Gambler
		That's not important. The real quesiton is, how much money will I win if you guess the winner of this race?
		Blake
		I'm working on it.

		You really think so? Fancy Pants is a serious underdog.
		Blake
		Trust me. Remember, if I'm wrong, the washing machine is all yours.
		Gambler
		OK, I put all of my money on Fancy Pants.
		Blake
		Great! It looks like the horses are all at the gate. And they're off!
		Gambler
		Ah, I can't watch. I should never have taken your advice!
		Blake
		No, look! Fancy Pants is leading the pack! They're almost to the finish line, and --
		Gambler
		Unbelievable! It's Fancy Pants! This is incredible!
		Gambler
		You and I make a good team, you know. Let's find another game to bet on.
		Blake
		No thanks. I think I'll just take my drink now.
		Gambler
		Oh, right. One pint of beer, on me!
