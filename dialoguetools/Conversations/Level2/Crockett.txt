		I'm here tracking a legendary beast.
		Blake
		What kind of beast?
		Crockett
		A bear, big as they come, thirsty for blood.
		Blake
		Sounds intense. Are you afraid?
		Crockett
		Of course not. Bears are no match for Davy Crockett.

		On one occasion, I wrassled four wolves and three bears to the ground.
		Crockett
		I had nothing but my hands and my wits, but I sure wrassled them.
		Blake
		Do you think I could wrassle a wolf, Davy Crockett?
		Crockett
		If you dream hard enough, you can achieve anything!
