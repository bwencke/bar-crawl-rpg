		Look, get rid of the teddy bear, and I swear you'll start making friends with other fifteen-year-olds.

		Who says that I don't have any friends?
		Blake
		Do you have any friends?
		Child
		No.
		Child
		But I can't get rid of Cuddles until I find a good home for him!

		Sometimes you need to hear the truth, even when it hurts.
