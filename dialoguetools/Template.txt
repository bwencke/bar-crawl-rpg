Running the parser: python dialogue.py

- Each level has its own subdirectory in Assets/Conversations
- Each character has his or her own JSON file in the level directory

- SNIPPET/ENDSNIPPET is mandatory
- ASSIGNMENTS/ENDASSIGNMENTS is optional
- STATEMENTS/ENDSTATEMENTS is optional
- OPTION/ENDOPTION is optional
- CONDITION/ENDCONDITIONS is optional

- The parser ignores empty lines between SNIPPETs
- The parser ignores indentation
- The STATEMENTS section must have an even number of lines
- For an OPTION, the text can be JUMP and the ID can be END
- If an OPTION's text is JUMP, it should be the only OPTION and it should not have CONDITIONS
